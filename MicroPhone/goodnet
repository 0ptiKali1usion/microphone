Dear customers,
 
To improve the quality of our service we are implementing a few
changes to our internal systems.  We are adding additional servers to
help balance the load of our network.  To aid you in the transition we
are including instructions for GoodNet, Netzone, and C2I2 customers.


GoodNet Customers -

Currently all Goodnet customers are using mail.goodnet.com as their
SMTP and POP3 servers in your mail programs.

To speed up the service of sending mail from your computer to us, we
have added a new server smtp.goodnet.com, and to improve the
performance of when you are picking up mail we have added
pop.goodnet.com.

The following paragraphs explain how to setup the more popular mail
clients to use these new servers.
 
*******************************************************************
Eudora -

The only items that need to be changed in Eudora are...
1.) The pop Account setting
2.) The smtp server setting

Depending on your version of Eudora, it will vary where to change
this information.

(the newer versions) The change will be under TOOLS, then
OPTIONS, then HOSTS, in the space that reads "POP account" change
"your-username@mail.goodnet.com" to
"your-username@pop.goodnet.com".  Then for "SMTP" change
"mail.goodnet.com" to "smtp.goodnet.com". 
 
(older versions) The change will be under SPECIAL, then
CONFIGURATION or SETUP, in the space that reads "POP account"
change "your-username@mail.goodnet.com" to
"your-username@pop.goodnet.com".  Then for "SMTP server" change
"mail.goodnet.com" to "smtp.goodnet.com". 

*******************************************************************
Internet Mail -

Go to MAIL, then OPTION, then SERVERS, in the
space for "Outgoing Mail (SMTP)" replace mail.goodnet.com with
