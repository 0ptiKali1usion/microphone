How much is "very expensive"?

Power is what causes damage.  Current is what you feel.  The frequency
makes some difference too.  A good electrical contact and even a 9 volt
(try your tongue)  battery can cause problems.  (People in to temporary
peircings should advoid batterys!)  A Weight belt and 2 one inch size
contacts on bare skin should be quits effective.

It is the voltage that cuts through the clothes.  5-10 K will go through
most anything.  Some of the stun guns clame to put out 80K.  There is
somthing to be said for men without shirts
though.

> The belt appears to get over this problem.

My guess is that is a "stun gun" electronics  with a remote switch.
Probably less electronics than your doggy-gadget.  My reading of
the waist belts description is that once the 8-second starts there is no
control.  This would be due to the noise level  of the high-voltage
generation and arcing (Lots of rf noise).

Cindy,

The address information for red does not seem to have made it 
past west.  BIND needs to have a version number set for it to update 
other servers.  Does the DNS server for VMS have a similar concept?
Anyway, please see if you can get the information to propagate.  
red is basicly down until it is in the name server system.

As of 9:30 Sunday:

Server:  zul.dco.pima.edu

Ian,

I hve been getting some play in.  -- by myself.  Which is OK,
Sometimes I think it would be safer with someone else around.
I have been playing with a Stokes? (basket) stretcher.  It
has lots of places to tie down people.  I just haven't figured out
how to tie down my arms along with the rest of my body.  Oh well.
The HR straps work well for the wrists!

Any word from TK?  I expect you may be as upset by it as me.
I would like to be able to help.  But if he doesn't call or write
there is little I can do.  I am still VERY glad for the times
we had together and the friendship.  I hope some day he will get 
in touch.

Plan to be in SF for a week in August.  Hope all is well.  Call some time.
(520) 327-4133.  [Befor 9:30 our time.] Or let me know when 
I might reach you. - Louis

You are right, money is not everything!

Not much time.  Hope it goes well.

Do IP masqurading and get a single fixed IP address.  It should work just
as well for most things.  (And a lot cheaper.)

Good luck with your move.  - Louis

The metal detectors can disrupt the data - (But not all of them).
For PC systems the format command checks on the disk first.  So it
does quite a bit more than just a format.  Try taking a magnet to
the disk to wipe out any and all formatting, then try again.  - Louis

Cia,

How is the house working out.  Did they squat on you, or move
out on "time"?  Moving is always a hassel.  (Though I haven't done it
in about 14 years now, and that move was only about 2 miles.)

When your schedule looks free, give me a call.  327-4133 Home, 206-6039
Work.  I would like to get together again.  I guess I can show up on
Sundays too.  This Sunday is a TFUG meeting.  - Louis
