Greetings,
Rather than jump into a strange and unnecessary argument I will try to
provide some
links that deal with the origional question asked.  I will start with an
interesting and
informative web page -
        http://www.goodnet.com/~mcavoy
called "The Gay Pagan Haven" and maintained by Chas McAvoy
(mcavoy@goodnet.com)
Then there is "Mariposa's Wings" at
-
        http://www.tezcat.com/~mariposa/
This is another Gay/Lesbian pagan web page.  There is THE MOONOAK
HOMEPAGE -
        http://www.afn.org/~afn09744/
which is listed as a "Radical Faerie Page".  You may also wish to check
out "Rainbow Wind!"
        http://users.aol.com/RainboWind/rbwintr.htm
They are a group for Lesbigay Pagans and their friends who maintain this
page.
Also, I picked up this info on the web...
From: PathPerDiv@aol.com
Here are some Lesbigay Pagan sources, several taken from the brochure
_Sexual Orientation and Wicca_, written by Magnolia Stuart, editor of
the Pagan
publication _Coming Out Pagan_ (Outpagan@aol.com):

Bearwolf, Mongo. "Talking Softly with the Goddess," _Green Egg_, Issue
#100 (PO Box 1542, Ukiah, CA 95482).

Blotcher, Jay.  "That Ol' Lavender Magic!" _Outweek_ #70, October 31,
1990.

Butler, Edward P. "Aphrodite and Polarity," _Green Egg_, Issue #112.

Connor, Randy P. _Blossom of Bone: Reclaiming the Connections Between
Homoeroticism and the Sacred_..  San Francisco, CA: HarperSanFrancisco,
1993.

Dominguez, Ivo Jr. "Sabbats and Sexuality: Sense and Sensibility,"
_Green Egg_ Issue #100.

Evans, Arthur. _Witchcraft and the Gay Counterculture_. Boston: Fag Rag
Books, 1978.

Grahn, Judy. _Another Mother Tongue: Gay Words, Gay Worlds_. Boston:
Beacon Press, 1984.

Larkin, Purusha. _The Divine Androgyne_. San Diego, CA: Sanctuary
Publications, 1981.

Lissie. "Coming Out Twice: Proud to be a Pagan!" _Coming Out Pagan_,
Winter 1993: Vol. 1, No. 1, page 12 (PO Box 12942, Tucson AZ 85732-2942)

Murray, Judy Caroline. "Mother's Penis Venus Daughters," _Green Egg_,
Issue #100.

Roscoe, Will. "Living the Tradition: Gay American Indians" in _Gay
Spirit: Myth and Meaning_. Mark Thompson, editor. New York: St. Martin's
Press,
1987.

Roscoe, Will. _Queer Spirits_, 1995, Beacon Press, Boston, MA.

Starchild, Rowan. "In  Goddess and God I Trust," _Coming Out Pagan_,
Winter 1993: pages 5-6.

Thompson, Mark, editor. _Gay Spirit: Myth and Meaning_. New York: St.
Martin's Press, 1987.

Walker, Mitch. _Visionary Love: A Spirit Book of Gay Mythology_. San
Francisco, CA: Treeroots Press, 1980.

Williams, Walter L. _The Spirit and the Flesh: Sexual Diversity in
American Indian Culture_. Boston: Beacon Press, 1986.

Yohalem, John. "Coming Out of the Broom Closet", _The Advocate_ #589,
November 5, 1991.

I haven't read all of these personally, but the Grahn book is excellent,
and Wilfred von Dauster wrote a very favorable review of _Queer Spirits_
for
the December '95 issue of _Rainbow Wind Magazine_ (our publication).
John
Yohalem is also the editor/publisher of _Enchante: The Journal for the
Urbane Pagan_.

Some back issues of "Coming Out Pagan" are still available, to the best
of my understanding; you may want to contact Magnolia (Outpagan@aol.com)
about
them.

Hope this helps, and blessed be!
