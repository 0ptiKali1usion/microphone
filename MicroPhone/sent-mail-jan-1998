I just got 64Mbytesfor my system at home.  I took the 32 out and took it
to work.  My NT system at work mow has 48Mbytes.  As to why:  Most
systems today will run better/faster with more memory.  They take
data off of the hard disk and keep it in memory.

Memory is about $2/Mbyte right now.  The memory I got was with parity
and the "price" was $69 for each 32Mbytes.  After shipping, a little more.
I still have places in my computer for an additional 6 simms.  That would
put it at 256Mbytes. (For about $420. Not now!)  - Louis

I was thinking of their play space, not their board.
Theirs is a suspended board.  Made with 2-bys.  It is about the shape
of a body.  Velcro tie downs.  Not very good for one person.

I also have a military cot.  It works very well.  Tie points at the head,
middle, and feet.  What more could you need ?  And a stolks(?)  stretcher
(a basket stretcher)  metal frame work with chicken wire.  The stretcher
would work better with help too.  I want, some day, to get a back board. 
Take a look on the net some day at some of the emergency saftey equipment
companies.  (Like iron duck, I think) 

Best wishes, - Louis

You may want to look at www.thechipmerchant.com for memory prices.  It is
a good time to buy memory right now.  My 32meg (parity) simms were $72
each, shipping included.   - Louis
