I guess that you have had no luck with e-mail.  If they are back east
you might try before 8:00am to keep the phone call cost down.  I would
at least like to get my e-mail off if it is posible.  I was not expecting
them to pull the plug like this.  Oh-well, I guess you didn't expect it
eather.  Let me know what the calls cost,  I will help.  

I was back east in SC with my Aunt.  She has been in the hospital.
I don't think she will live much longer.  Probably a year on the outside.
She is not eating.  Sleeps a lot.  Does not drink much.  Was quite a week.
Lets talk soon.  - Louis

Snndy, it is not a real big problem.  I just like to keep my personal
stuff off of the school system.  The "school" system that I get mail on is
mostly my hardware anyway.  (My box, motherboard, memory, one of the disk
drives [the largest]...)  Take a look at my pages -- if you want.
