Subject: The Sioux Spaceman by way of Introduction

Well, I've not posted here in a while and now that my server problem is solved
I can post without mail bouncing (a long story, very boring).

So here goes...

While looking around the playroom deciding what was going to Inferno and what
wasn't I reflected on why I got all involved in this BDSM scene thing.
Suddenly a single picture entered my mind which pretty much summed up those
things I really enjoy.

Let me explain...

When I was a kid I was a big fan of science fiction.  My parents would stuff
Xmas stockings with 5 or 6 paperbacks.  One year I received a book by Andre'
Norton called "The Sioux Spaceman".  It carried the very fantasic art covers of
the day and I can vividly remember some interesting things about it.

The Sioux Spaceman was featured as a rather muscle bound lad with feathered
mask.  He wore a tight sleeveless shirt and, of course, the gratutious tight
pants.  He clutched in his hand a remote control with little antennas coming
out of it.  Behind him was a little chain gang of three men with ripped
clothes, no shoes and metal collars on their necks.  Their collars were chained
together and each collar had an antenna coming out from the back.  Of course
the spaceman looked very happy at his controls and the three men didn't.

So I started to piece all my little fetishes together and found they pretty
much fit this little scenereo.

Native Americans somehow always end up in those masterbation or BDSM scenes
either as a top, tormenting some settler or incarcerated in some whiteman's
jail, or performing some painful Sundance ritual.  My house is loaded with
Native American stuff.

The collar/jourg is always a wonderful addition to any scene and, of course,
this picture comes to mind.

The electronic aspect probably comes from that as well - to remotely control
someone and/or let the electronic tools of the trade occupy a bottoms space.
The top can get tired but the tools can continue - fail that and old standbys,
metal restraints take over.  I'd often wondered about using a computer to
establish ground rules for a bottom (how far to sit/stand etc.) then change
those rules leaving that individual to "figure it out" while some form of
devious punishment is dished out.  The virtual top is programmed by the real
top and executed.  The top of course can relax and survey the whole operation.
I *did* pick up a book on hardware automated systems for the PC.

Ah well, this ends up being an introduction of sorts.  How did others find
their interest and was it related to some child experience which prompted it at
a later date?  How does it affect your play?  Good/bad?  Does it affect the way
you interact with others?  Do you internalize some images while playing which
the other player or players are not aware?

That's it for now,

Tom

You may very well be interested in this collar description that was 
posted to another list.  I don't know if the outfit making these is 
legit, but if I ever have the $$$, I'm definitely going to get one...

==== cut here ====

What is it?

The XRC-2000 is a sturdy locking collar that can be adjusted to
fit around virtually any neck.  It is controlled by an RF remote
control and has numerous features.  All settings on the collar
can be adjusted from the remote control during use, there are
no knobs or switches that need to be adjusted on the collar.
The enormous functionality is possible because of an alphanumeric
Liquid Crystal Display which allows you to set up the features
that you wish to use.  Many users will find that they prefer some
of its features over others.  Its keypad is fully configurable so
that people can set their favourite functions one or two keypresses
away and use the keypad the way they feel is most logical and
natural in order to streamline its use in a scene.  It is water
resistant so that it can be showered in in case it is to be used
for extended lengths of time.  It has a tamper resistant mode
where is will punish automatically if the wearer attempts to pick
the lock or cut through the collar.



Included in the set:

1   Collar
1   Remote control
1   Foam padded black ABS case
1   Earphone    (see Speak mode)
1   Tamper plug
1   Chain leash dongle
1   Hands back dongle
1   User's manual
1   Technical Manual (just for the curious)
2   9V alkaline batteries



Features:

Zap             Eleven different zap level settings plus a "ramp up"
                mode where it zaps at a higher level each time.

Warning beep    A beep can be set to sound just before a zap will
                occur.  It can be set so that the zap will not
                occur if the problem is corrected within a certain
                length of time.

Beep            A beep that sounds just like the warning beep can
                be sounded manually with no zap.  This can be fun
                if they've gotten used to having the zap always
                follow the beep.

Speak           The owner can record up to thirteen different
                messages in their own voice.  Whatever commands
                they want to give to their slave (e.g. "come here",
                "on your knees", etc...).  The collar allows the
                top to control what their slave does and if
                necessary deliver punishment all with the control
                in their pocket and with no visible sign to
                bystanders.  (speech is stored in a chip that
                requires no battery power to maintain storage,
                messages will remain for one hundred years or
                until they are re-recorded by the top.  They can
                be re-recorded ten thousand times or more before
                sound quality degrades)

Lock buttons    Allows you to quickly lock the keys on the remote
                control so that they cannot be pressed accidentaly.

Lock Collar     You can enter a code so that the collar settings
                cannot be changed (even by another remote control)
                without entering a code (chosen by the top).

Invisible Leash The collar can be set to punish automatically if
                the wearer wanders too far away from the remote
                control.  There are three different distance settings.

Chain Leash     A chain can be attached to the front of the collar.
                It will punish if this chain is removed.

Head Down       Punishment will be administered if the wearer raises
                their head.

Hands back      The wearer must keep both of their hands touching the
                rear of the collar.  The hands back dongle is used,
                it is a small tybe which can be snapped onto the
                back of the collar.  The wearer must keep their fingers
                inserted into the ends (imagine an electronic version
                of a chinese finger puzzle).

Don't Move      Motion sensitivity

Tamper Studs    The decorative silver colored studs can be set to be
                touch sensitive.  The wearer is not allowed to touch
                these studs, but anyone else can.

Aux In/Out      A plug on the back of the collar is provided (with
                gold plated contacts) for future toys.  (the specs
                will be provided for any techies who want to play
                with it)

RC ID#          One remote control can control up to ten collars,
                individually or simultaniously.

RS-232          The remote control can be connected to nerarly any
                computer.  Have your slaves act out a video game or
                dial in to your computer and control them from work.
                (no software has been written yet, but the command
                list is included for any techies who want to play.
                Simple programming examples are given in BASIC)

     New: A program is now available upon request to allow you to
          customize the power-on and ready messages, for example
          mine are: "Hello Charlie..." & "I'm ready Master"

Tamper plug     A small chain can be connected from the remote
                control to the top's belt loop or elewhere.  If
                the slave attempts to take the control away and
                the chain is pulled on, it will automatically send
                the punish command.

LCD Backlight   For use in darkness



Safety:

Safeword button The collar has a button on the back that will shut
                it down completely when pressed and sound a tone.
                this feature can be disabled by the top.

ECC             The RF signal is Error Corrected so that the collar
                cannot be falsely triggered by other devices.

High frequency  The zap produced by the collar is high frequency to
                limit its bio-activity.  (i.e. the human body tends
                to ignore high frequency electricity making it far
                safer to play with)

Maximum zaps    There is a maximum number of times that the collar
                can zap all at once, after which the collar will
                shut down.  This can be adjusted by the top but not
                disabled.  It can however be set high enough that it
                should never be a problem during a scene.


How do I get it?

The complete set is $950 in US currency (you may inquire about foreign
currency).  Software upgrades will be available in the future (with even
more features) for the cost of shipping.

Dad,

It does sound fabulous.  I do want one!  Please, please, can I have one? 
How much do I have to beg????

(P.S. Is this thing really real?  Can it be obtained on a trial basis? 
Maybe we should go 50/50 on it or I should start saving now).
