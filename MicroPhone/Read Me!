This makes available the power of sophisticated scripts such as the documents included in your MicroPhone package, and others like Loran, an automated mail reader, the MiniBBS, providing remote dial-in capabilities, and anything else written by owners of MicroPhone II and MicroPhone Pro. Many scripts are available on bulletin boards and information services around the world. MicroPhone LT does not let you edit or create scripts of your own. To develop your own scripts, contact Software Ventures Corporation about upgrading to MicroPhone II or MicroPhone Pro using one of the electronic mail addresses at the end of this document.____________________________________________________________SAVING DISK SPACEYou can reduce the amount of hard disk space used by MicroPhone and related files by removing files you don’t use. First consider removing unused modem drivers from the Modem Folder. Next, settings documents and associated folders, such as Dow Jones and CompuServe, can be removed to save disk space. If removing all the settings documents does not give you enough space, you can also remove MPToolBox. MPToolBox contains features such as icons, sounds, character translation tables and external commands. Some settings documents will not work properly without MPToolBox. (Advanced users familiar with ResEdit can remove the unused contents of MPToolBox, leaving the file on disk and avoiding MicroPhone’s warning about missing it.)____________________________________________________________CONFIGURING YOUR MODEM MicroPhone comes with modem drivers for many of the most popular modems. Before establishing a communications session, be sure to configure MicroPhone to work with your modem. This enables MicroPhone to take advantage of advanced features of your modem, minimizing communication problems. - Select Communications from the Settings menu. - Select your modem from the list in the Communications Settings dialog box. - Select other settings such as databits, baud rate and parity. If your modem supports compression (V.42bis of MNP-5), set the baud rate to the highest setting supported by your modem. For example, choose 57,600 for a 14,400 bps/V.42bis modem. - Select the flow control setting that matches your modem cable. Many high-speed modems come with a hardware-handshake cable, allowing you to use hardware flow control. If you are not sure what type of cable you have, contact your modem manufacturer, or just experiment with the settings. Using the wrong setting will usually cause file transfers to fail. - When you are done selecting settings, click OK to close the window and then save the settings document. You must make these changes once for each document you use.____________________________________________________________USING MICROPHONE COMMAND-PERIOD: MicroPhone’s script language allows a script author to alter how command-period operates. Using command-period or clicking the Abort button stops certain actions while allowing others activated by scripts to continue. The script can be written to repeat the action. Holding down the command and period keys stops all activity, including script execution unless the script author has disabled command period.POWERBOOKS: Apple’s PowerBooks 160/165c/180 freeze (crash) if they are put to sleep with an open connection. Shortly after the PowerBook is woken,  it freezes, preventing use of the keyboard and trackball. To recover, you must restart. (System memory is severely damaged by the waking process when a connection is open.) To avoid the problem, be sure to close the connection (Phone menu) before sleeping. Consider using MicroPhone’s connection driver "MicroPhone Standard.closed" described in the Connection Folder to automatically close the connection when you choose Hang Up. To fix the problem, call 800-SOS-APPL and ask them if they have a new System Enabler to correct this.   Apple’s PowerBooks 100/140/170 can not receive data reliably at 4800 bps or more. To minimize this problem, be sure you are using System 7.1. If you are transmitting text at high speeds, avoid putting MicroPhone in the background and activating tasks such as copying files. Minimize the effects of data loss by using MicroPhone’s file transfer protocols (XMODEM, YMODEM, ZMODEM and Kermit) to transmit data. (The transfers will take longer with MicroPhone in the background.)   Also note that if you specify hardware flow control without a cable and modem supporting hardware flow control, all activity on the PowerBook will stop when you type in the terminal window. Pressing command-period is the only way to regain control. Avoid this problem by checking your hardware before choosing hardware flow control. SCREEN BUFFER: The size of the screen buffer is limited by the amount of memory available to MicroPhone. To increase the size of the screen buffer when running under MultiFinder or System 7, increase MicroPhone’s application memory size from the Finder’s Get Info menu command. Your Macintosh documentation provides more information about this feature.VIRTUAL MEMORY: Using virtual memory with a large screen buffer can delay receiving information to the screen once the screen buffer fills up. This happens when insufficient memory is available and the system switches to virtual memory.CONTROL CHARACTERS: To generate control characters, hold down the Control key on your keyboard and type the character. Use either the Option key or the Command key if your keyboard does not have a Control key. You can change your Control key preference under the Settings menu. For the Macintosh Plus, changing the Control key to the Command key occurs automatically the first time you use MicroPhone. Changing the Control key works only in the terminal window. HAYES MODEM TOOL: The Hayes Modem Tool version 1.0 for use with the Macintosh Communications Toolbox (CTB) is not compatible with MicroPhone. You must be using version 1.0.2 or later. Contact Hayes customer support or call their BBS (1-800-USHAYES) for an updated version of the modem tool. ____________________________________________________________CONTACTING SOFTWARE VENTURESYou can send messages to Software Ventures technical support on the following electronic services:America Online (our address is SVCTECH)AppleLink (our address is SVCTECH)BIX (our address is SVC)CompuServe (our address is 76004,2161)GEnie (our address is SVCTECH)Internet (our address is microphone@svcdudes.com)MCI (our address is 286-6859)Telex (our address is 650 286-6859)You can FAX SVC at (510) 848-0885.The Software Ventures BBS offers the latest information, technical support, public domain and shareware files, as well as new scripts, settings documents and modem drivers.
