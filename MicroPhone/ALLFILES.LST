                                  the same file with different names.       
                                  NAME2NUM converts filenames to the CRC32  
                                  of the file contents.  Multiple copies if 
                                  the same file can be detected and         
                                  optionally deleted. NAME2NUM runs under   
                                  DOS, WINDOWS and W95. Source code is      
                                  included. Conversion to UNIX is *easy*    
                                  and should run on almost any NIX box.
