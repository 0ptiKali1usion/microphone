G'day to you all from a land downunder

Firstly just to fore-warn that I am new to this list, and as such hope that I 
am not about to ask about an issue that may have been covered during recent 
months.

Firstly a little about myself.... I have been playing off and on in the d/s 
world for 12 years now, since the age of 18 (lightening maths and voila, we 
have an age!).  Over the last (maybe) four years I have undergone the 
transition from bottom to top, occasionally still switching back to my 
submissive role.

Now comes the tricky part (for me) .... I am straight (if there is such a 
thing) but over the last year bi, or straight gay, fantasies have becoming 
stronger and stronger in me.  I have thought hard on these, I come from a very 
straight background, and have come to realise that these fantasies revolve 
around being used as the slave and never in a vanilla setting or as a top.

My thoughts on this are that it may be my subconscious yearning for this, but 
upbringing fighting it, and thus this way there is the old "I was forced into 
it, I had no choice" sort of cop out.  Any views from anyone on that one?

I would be interested in anyones ideas on what I am going through, 
particularly views on a first gay experience being as a bottom.  I have no 
idea if I am alone in this or it is is relatively common.

Please do not misunderstand me, I do not think I am fighting against my 
possible leaning, just trying to understand it, so that I might decide if I 
will try this for myself.  I have my own (female) slave and she too is ready 
for a same sex experience for the first time, the only difference being is 
that she knows she desires this and just awaits the right lady, whereas I only 
think I may do and (please do not flame me anyone) quite frankly it scares me 
a little.

Anyway, thanks for reading if you've got this far, I look forward to any 
advice people may wish to contribute.

G'day

Thanks for your reply to my posting, a couple of people have replied and it is 
great to speak to people about it.  Your position is most like my own, more so 
that you will realise ........  (will unfold a little as I reply)

>I had a great trip "downunder" many years ago.  Hope to do it again!
 

Yup. tis a pretty neat country I think :)

>My wife does not play.  When I play it is (has) been with gay men.  I 
>really like the way they play.  The energy is really ther for me.
 
My wife does not play (hey, that has a familiar ring to it ;)  I have played 
with female slaves, indeed I own one in the states who recently visited me, 
she is lovely :)

>Several thoughts.  I took a "Sexual Additude Restructuring" class
>righr after I got married!  It took me from being quit homophobic
>to quite comfortable.  The other aspect of me is I read a lot.
>John Money has some good books.  Any was I am a DES baby.  A hormone
>given to my mother near my birth.  That is what I attribute my
>kinky interest to.
 
It was this lovely slave of mine who has opened my eyes to men.  She (online 
and fantasy irl but without another person actually involved) has introduced 
me to the feelings of gay love, the deep emotions, and I was amazed how 
beautiful and non threatening I found it.  She has made me fel very comfy and 
taught me that I am almost certainly bi, and I only use the word "almost" 
there as not having done anything physically I may be wrong (but doubt it).

At gay pride - after the parade -  with Hal.  A walk down Market street
back to the car.  Hands behind my back.  A head harnnes on.  On a rope
lead.  Several people have pictures - Not a clue who though.  It was 
*GREAT*

*WHIMPER* That sounds amazing!!!!!!  I'd love her to do that to me (when we 
sometimes switch) it must have been wonderful :)
  
>For advice?  Play safe.  Play parties are a good place to start.
>Meet people and get to know them first.  (I *LIKE* a feeling
>of *FEAR* but I really want to *KNOW* that I am in *VERY* good hands)

I agree, I thrive on the fear, but ultimately must feel safe.  My idea first 
experience would be with someone there I knew would quietly watch and jump in 
to save me if needed, then I could enjoy the fear.  My slave has offered this 
and would be perfect, but sadly I will not see her again for some time :(

>Have fun!  Explore!  There are mixed parties in some areas.

Not here there arn't in my area of the country even sex between married 
couples is illegal ;)  I do want to explore, there was a gay place into BDSM 
in Sydney when I was there recently, but it was too large a step for me for my 
first encounted.

>Let me know how it goes.   Have a *GREAT* / *GRAND* time.  I have.

>Louis Taber

Thanks Louis, I'll let you know when something happens, and if you ever get 
back to Oz drop me a line and I'll buy you a beer.  Please can you drop me an 
e-mail with your e-mail address in it for that.  This system I use tells me it 
is from you (by name) but I can't seem to extract the e-mail address to record 
elsewhere (this is sent using a reply and the system must know the address)

>ps. Check out URL  http://www.blacksteel.com/~yossie  

Address noted, will check it out :)
