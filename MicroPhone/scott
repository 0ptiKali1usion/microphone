Scott,

  YEP  8-)

> Self bondage, huh?  Ever gotten stuck?
  No.  I try to play very safe.  I use a dual timer system.  One cuts
  the circuit at 2am every day.  (I also would like to think that my wife
  would notice that I was missing sooner or later.) I also have a 9 year
  old daughter.

  I like Mark a lot.  He is real clear about his commitment to BDSM.
  Bring bf along.  Perhaps you can tie him up.  Though when it
  comes to getting IT into a relationship I have been a flop!  8-)

  Speedway & Swan.  On about half an acre.  The lot is 180x150 feet.
  I have a small out bulding for my "stuff".   I like my space a lot.
  Lets talk.  My number is (520) 327-4133.  9:30 is about the latest
  good time for incomming calls.

I mostly like gags, dildos & ass play, water sports, collars, leather cuffs,
shaving, long BDSM sessions, the idea of a 24/7 Master/slave relationship,
enforced chastity, etc.  I'm 95% bottom, altho I think I might eventually
top.  First, tho, I want to play around a bit with my bottom side.

Are you bi?  I used to date women, but only until I finally figured I needed
to come out -- for me, men were the only thing I really wanted.  :::sigh:::

;)

Talk soon?

I know what you mean.  I'm over on the gay side of the pasture (tho I did
have a girlfriend for three years) and what I love is the pure maleness of
men.  It is hard to explain, but altho I like the female "softness" that
many women have, it gives me no sexual charge at all.  And for the same
reasons, I don't get into "feminization" in play -- I want to be tied up and
held captive and made less than a man by a man, not made into another sex.
There's clinics in Europe to cater to that sorta thing.  ;)

Talk soon,

-Scott
