I've just received word from DM International ( (P O Box 16188, Seattle,

It may be part of the burn-out cycle. And we're running out of fresh 
blood that is reckless enough to try to make a go ouf it.

However, I hear that Joseph Bean and some assocaites have picked up a 
small group of the Men's magazines (including, I think, "Bear") and are 
trying to make a go of it.

I'm one of the editors of Prometheus, which is published by The 
Eulenspiegel Society. We printed 72 pages last issue and sales outside 
our membership is growing.  But, if we had to pay for the time the staff 
put into getting the magazine together, it wouldn't fly.  It's done on a 
volunteer basis, and we're counting on a continuing flow of dedicated 
staff and contributors to make it work.

I'd like to do it for a living.  I don't think I can, so I won't quit my 
day job.

They are not very well known. Their most "commercial" release to date has 
been "Love's Secret Domain", the track called "Windowpane" being a bit of 
a hit on the dancefloor - a shame, IMO, as it was one of the weakest Coil 
products ever. I suppose that's why it appealed to the 'masses' - it's 
certainly very much an "easy listening" piece when compared to their 
usual work. 

One other incident of exposure to the public that Coil has had this side 
of the Atlantic was the inclusion of one of their videos into the 
permanent collection of the Museum of Modern Art (the first video 
to be so honoured), after it had been rejected by most video 
distributors as "sick". The video, starring John Balance and Mark Almond,
is overtly a message from the early days of the AIDS crisis; more deeply, 
a symbolic exploration of the figure of Azrael, The Angel of Death, from 
a mid-80s-AIDS-centered perspective. The song is "Tainted Love", a cover of 
Soft Cell.

Of course Simon Fisher-Turner  was Jarman's main collaborator; as you 
say, Coil contributed only "soundbites". You will hear them in "The 
Angelic Conversation" and "Blue". There may be more I do not know of.  
There's certainly some theatre-pieces both Jarman and Coil worked on, and 
a painting by Jarman is on the cover of How To Destroy Angels.
(Fwiw, Throbbing Gristle appears in "In the Shadow of the Sun".)

It must be clear by now that I am a great devotee of Coil's, and could 
ramble on for hours. But I realize that even though they are an extremely 
gay-positive group, I am straying from the sort of dicussion proper 
to this forum, so I won't. Actually, they _do_ put me in a very D/s sort 
of space.... But that's a whole 'nother post. Till then let's take this 
to email if anyone's still interested.

As a last little bit of BDSM relevance I'll mention that they wrote the 
soundtrack to "Hellraiser III" :). Unfortunately Clive Barker finally 
decided to reject it because..... it was too "gut-churning". Oh yeah, and 
some of the music on "A Gay Man's Guide to Safer Sex" too...

Orbis, whose name, among many other things, can be translated as Coil.

I get frustrated trying to buy the kind of ass toys that fit easily up my butt,
(they're all either too fat or too thin, too long or too short) and also to
find special-purpose ones to fulfil certain of the fantasies my overworked
imagination dreams up for me <g>.

My solution has been to make my own custom-sized butt toys.  Apart from the
obvious advantage of custom sizing, they're cheap, and you can make lots of
different ones for different purposes.  I've made two butt plugs, a dildo and
two "tails" so far and I intend to make one with a tube down the middle and a
funnel on the outside end so that Daddy can pour whatever he likes into my ass
(or my mouth if he puts it in that end) and I have other ideas too.

The basic materials are moulded foam pipe insulation (the kind that comes in 3
foot lengths with a hole down the middle - to put on hot water pipes), PVC
electrical tape (insulating tape to Brits) and a kind of liquid rubber stuff
called "Plasti-Dip" which is used for putting a rubber/plastic coating on the
outside of things like tool handles.  Available here in Canada from good tool
shops like Lee Valley Tools, but it's made in the US.

Method is -
1.  cut yourself a suitable length of foam - you probably know what's a
    good length for you, and if you don't, err on the short side (4" or so) to
    start with. You can always make longer ones later.
2.  Round off one end roughly with scissors
3.  Put something in the hole at the other end of the foam to act as a
    stiffener and stop the toy from sliding in too far (eg a _short_ wooden
    dowel of the appropriate size with a flat piece of wood attached across one
    end). Make sure you don't use anything which could puncture the foam and
    injure you.
4.  Wrap the whole thing tightly and thoroughly with several layers of tape.
    I found it best to start in the middle and work towards the tip, stopping
    once had the foam bent inwards to a nice rounded point. Then I placed
    several short lengths of tape across the tip and back along the length. The
    start just back of the tip and wind over the short lengths and along to the
    back end.  Wrapping the back end is a bit awkward and takes some fiddling.
    When you finish the last wrap, don't stretch the end of the tape too much
    as you stick it down - it will creep backwards under the plastic coating
    and rip it.
5.  Use the plasti-dip to coat the outside with a continuous smooth layer. This
    takes several coats and you will probably have to do one end, then the
    other end, overlapping in the middle, and back to the first end again.

"Tails" made by this method are a lot of fun - I made one which has vinyl
flogger tails hanging out of the plug section & which hang out of my ass when
I'm wearing it - very useful, Daddy can whip it out and whack me with it if the
mood strikes. It's quite amusing for onlookers if I swing my butt from side to
side because the tails start swinging too, and whacking me - unfortunately on
the upper thighs instead of the ass.  The other has heavy chain hanging out of
it.  Just make sure that the sections which will be in your ass are smooth and
coated with the rubber so they can't do any damage. You also need something to
stop it from continuing to work its way deeper into your ass - a crossbar of
some kind.

There are two sizes of the foam, for 1/2" pipe and 3/4" pipe. I used the 1/2"
size and found it perfect once it was bound up with tape. YMMV. The foam is
also useful for other things, eg covering sling suspension chains if they're
too noisy, or covering something to be used as a bit or gag in the mouth. You
could even use it to insulate your hot water pipes if you're really stuck for a
use for the bits you have left over <g>.

I received the message below from Drew RE my recent posts on the absence of
news about and available copies of the new "Servant's Quarters" zine.  What
she says relates to our recent discussion here about s/m publishing: There
*are* publications of significant value to the community that are nonetheless
labors of love or even hobbies for those who put them out, and in these cases
we need to cut a considerable amount of slack.  Much as I, or anyone, might
wish a zine like SG to come out more often, have a larger print run and
better distribution, or meet any other criteria from professional publishing,
under the kind of circumstances Drew describes, we have no right to demand
it.

OTOH (and IMHO, YMMV, and all that stuff), I think we have every right to
expect more from commercial publications that support themselves by selling
us, their customers, to advertisers.  I am just *very* tired of hearing
incompetent or cynically exploitative gay/lesbian publishers make excuses for
years on end -- crying all the way to bank in some cases -- instead of
delivering quality products on schedule and fairly compensating their
artists, photographers, and writers.

favorite kind!). 

That's also the reason you haven't heard a lot about the zine. Yes, it came
out; yes, it sold out very quickly. It's being handled by a couple of mail
order companies (QSM, Blowfish)...they may still have some copies on hand. If
some kind soul with a car would like to do distribution for me, even in SF,
I'd, I'd...well, we'd have to talk, but I'd at least be grateful! ;-) But as
long as I'm working 50 hours a week, SQ is going to stay in the "cool fun
thing I do when I get around to it" category. (I know some of my more
enterprising friends are groaning, but hey. Gotta pay the rent.) 

The general info is as follows: subscriptions are $14, sample copies are $4
(included age statement, blah blah). Issue #2 is due out in early Spring, but
I'll reserve copies for folks who send money now. Monies, written and graphic
(and graphic written) work, and requests for info can be sent by (gasp!)
snail mail to:

Six of the Best Publishing
2215-R Market Street #264
San Francisco CA 94114

General info stuff and work can be sent to:

ServantsQ@aol.com *or* Favea@aol.com

Feel free to post this to gl-asb if you like. I'm always looking for
well-written smut about submission and also for feature articles.

Good to hear from you!

It's different to a very great extent, I'd say; in fact, for those
straight SMers who discover their kink as adults, or for whom their kink
isn't terribly intense, there are more differences than similarities, IMO.
Even kinky heterosexuals mostly don't have the consciousness of a minority
sexuality.  Your average heterosexual doesn't think anything about hir
sexuality, because it's not significant.  It's not made to be significant,
it's not made to be an issue by the culture around us.  Gays and lesbians,
on the other hand, are used to the idea that their sexuality has
implications beyond the bedroom.  I know I see much more consciousness of
this among gay and lesbian SMers, whereas the heterosexuals that I observe
in the scene seem to concern themselves almost exclusively with the thing
itself -- the activity, the sensation, whatever.  Also, I get the feeling
that "stay at home/play at home" is much more prevalent among
heterosexuals.  Gay and lesbian SMers seem to like to socialize with their
kind, and not just to get dates.

   I wish someone with the right skills would do this as a project; it would
   be so good for so many people just starting out to have role models. 

I like the idea of a film, myself.  Jennie Livingston, where are you????

Well, there's a third option: relationships that aren't based around a

please do; better information would be most welcome. It seems most of 
what is available ranges from poor to mediocre. What do you think of 
Edward Peters' book on torture (Blackwell, 1985)? 
Any bibliographic suggestions would be most welcome.

For anyone planning a trip to Rothenburg, there are two more places to visit
in the vicinity. Regensburg is another well preserved medieval city - though
without Rothenburg's fortifications - and claims Europe's only surviving
original torture chamber. Apparently the other ones were recreated or
re-stocked at a later time. I have no idea if this claim is accurate, but
the town is pretty and worth a visit. 

Nuremberg lies between Rothenburg and Regensburg and has a castle with a
museum and a dungeon.

As for dungeons, my favourite was the oubliette I saw in an Austrian castle.
It was the only one I ever saw that actually had a trap door, just like in
the movies. In case someone is not familiar with the term 'oubliette' it
comes from the French word oublier - to forget - and refers to a narrow
underground shaft or chamber into which someone was dropped and left.

Puts a new spin on 'out of sight, out of mind'.

A much better museum of medieval and early modern judicial torture can be
found in Rothenberg, Germany. Rothenberg is a well preserved medieval
town, and a big tourist destination; it also houses the Museum of Criminal
Justice.  Like the AMsterdam Museum, this one also caters to the tourist
trade. However, it is a much more serious enterprise. The collection is
extensive, well documented, and well displayed. It contains not only
instruments, but also information and documentation of judical torture as
it was practiced in western and central Europe, although the focus of this
particular collection is Germany, which as Peter Boots pointed out, had a
relatively "enlightened" approach. The Rothenberg museum of criminal 
justice has been used as a research collection for serious historical 
work on european systems of "justice." 

"Torture" in this context is a bit misleading, even apart from the
confusion of judicial torture with torture for fun and sexual pleasure. 
There were two different kinds of painful judicial procedures which are
often lumped into the category of "torture." One category consisted of
techniques for questioning suspected criminals or heretics, and for
obtaining confessions of guilt. The second consisted of technologies for
punishing those who were convicted of crime or heresy.  The implements commonly 
seen in such museum "torture" displays are of both kinds. 

Torture as a means of obtaining "truth"  was highly regulated, and in
principle limited the amount of damage that could be inflicted upon a
subject. However, as Peter Boots and others pointed out, judicial torture
was not especially concerned with the physical preservation of its
subjects. While the interrogators were generally supposed to keep their
victims alive until they confessed or were released, they did not hesitate
to inflict severe and lasting bodily harm. Many of the implements used for
questioning inflicted permanent and disabling injuries, for example 
dislocated joints, scars from burning, etc. 

The tortures prescribed as punishment were specifically designed to
inflict serious degradation, extremely severe injury, or excruciating
preludes to painful execution. For example, breaking a person on a wheel
meant binding a person to something like a large wagon wheel, and breaking
all four limbs over the edge. The helpless and disabled person could then
be left on the wheel to slowly die and rot, or could be displayed for a
while and then taken down for further ministrations, such as
disemboweling, burning, or being drawn and quartered. They were not
intended to survive such procedures or emerge unscathed. 

Unlike conventional SM, in these situations was there was little concern
to protect the subject from serious or long term harm. Direct
confrontation with these instruments can overwhelm the capacity of fantasy
to gloss over such messy and inconvenient details. On the other hand, the
alchemy of fantasy often transmutes repugnant thoughts and images into
pleasurable ideas and feelings, and the implements of judical torture can
provide rich raw material for the inspiration of fantasy. These reactions
vary between individuals, or even within individuals. A walk through such 
a museum can provoke a hard one one minute and profound revulsion the
next. 

Many older European (or European-influenced) cities and castles have
displays of similar equipment, although most pale by comparison to the one
in Rothenberg.  For example, Lima Peru has a pretty interesting Museum of
the Inquisition. The Bishop's castle in Salzburg, Austria has a small
dungeon, and some equipment (including an interesting chair fitted with
wooden spikes). There is a lot of hype about the torture chamber at the
Tower of London, but after seeing Rothenberg, the hype was more evident
than the equipment. 

The Museum at Rothenberg has published a couple of books in English which 
show photos of some of the equipment and provide historical and analytic 
material on judicial torture; there is also a book called "Inquisition" 
which is in and out of print, with numerous photographs and illustrations 
of authentic torture equipment. There are now several academic studies of 
torture as a judicial procedure (both licit and illicit) as well.

  Can you please give the full citation? what language is it in?

Simply not true.  Much scholarly work has been done on torture, esp.
on less physically damaging methods such as sensory deprivation.
(That pesky old geneva convention, necessity is the mother of
invention and all that...) The US and canadian govts. funded a ton of
academic research done by esteemed psychologist D.O. Hebb at my alma
mater McGill University back during WWII, that according to a PBS
special from a while back now, was being used by the british gov't
against suspected IRA members.  Alas I do not have a reference for
this, or even a title.  Someone on ASB had a better memory than I,
the last time this topic came up, perhaps you might try polling a
wider audience.

I"d be willing to bet that Amnesty International has an extensive
bibliography and if you contacted them in an appropriately academiic
manner they'd point you at some legit sources of info.  "I'm trying to
plan a really cool mindfuck torture scene for my new slave" wouldn't
be the way I personally would approach them...

Here is a fuller citation:

You answer is right and wrong at the same time. Right as far as my over-
broad formulation be concerned. Thanks for pointing that out. Wrong
since the whole thread is _exclusively_ about the history of torture,
and what I said is true in this context.  100 %. :-)
Clear now ?

Unnecessary. Understood ?  On the other hand, I am always eager to learn
about new sources serendipitiously, and I should not forget to mention
the one outstanding American scholar who has contributed to the subject
in the English language. He has also spoken out his (justified and low)
opinion about American criminal procedure recently, on occasion of the
Simpson case; I mean John H. Langbein.
                     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
I would like to recommend, as further lecture *after* Fiorelli, his:

Just bought a fine and strange book called Harm's Way, which collects various
photos, most of which are about mayhem, but there's a very strange collection
at the start of the book of a woman forcing another into a very painful-looking
harness in order to pull a buggy...  All the photos, relevant to this list or 
not are beautifully chosen and laid out.  I was just so happy to find this that
I thought I'd share the find, as there seem to be a lot of bookish people on
this list.
	I was also wondering why no one's mentioned all the fantastic christian
torture literature, which all tends to be a little final, but nonetheless it's
intriguing stuff.  Eusebius' History of the Church (written around the fourth
century) has many crazed and quite fetishistic scenes involving big heartless
roman soldiers and wimpy christian martyrs...  Plus you can read it on the 
bus and everyone thinks you're a devoted catholic.  Feral House has also
published a book called Torments and Tortures of the Christian Martyrs by a
wonderfully troubled monk.  It's slow going, but fertile ground.
	Well, to end this poorly-written piece of mail, I should probably
mention that Harm's Way comes from a publisher called Twin Palms, in case
anyone wants to look for it.  It's awful pricey, but worth it to me.  Happy
reading.

Is this in print?  if so where?

Guess I should mention Page DuBois' _Torture and Truth_ (Routledge I think,
around '89-91), which is tangentially related -- a discourse-oriented study
of the relationship between (you guessed it) torture and truth in ancient
Greece.  A very interesting and enlightening read if you're at all
interested in classics; she concludes that Western notions of "truth" have
their origins in the torture of slaves.

There is a book I discovered as a child that I've not seen mentioned
in this thread yet.  When I was 12 and 13, I took German and Chinese
at Johns Hopkins University on the weekends.  While I was waiting to
be picked up afterward, I would ensconce myself in the Eisenhower
library. There I discovered a book entitled
_The_Pleasures_of_the_Torture_Chamber.  The book was somewhat aged,
having been printed in the first half of this century.  I've kept an
eye pealed for it for years, but have never found another copy.

The GL-ASB and GL-ASB-DIGEST mailing lists
==========================================
This fairly long message outlines the policies and procedures for these
mailing lists.  Please read it thoroughly, and save it for future 
reference.


Section 1:
What is it?  Who can subscribe?  What may be posted?
----------------------------------------------------

I.	What is "gl-asb"?

"gl-asb" is a mailing list for discussion of B&D/D&S/S&M interests and
practices involving same-sex partners.

II.	Why does this require separate space?

Many of the folks involved in the establishment of this list were
subscribers to the Usenet newsgroup "alt.sex.bondage"; hence the
historical "asb" in its name.  

Some of us at the time felt that our presence on alt.sex.bondage was
limited by some or all of the following factors:

- Some other people were uncomfortable with same-sex postings, and
  seemed to post back with extra ferocity and volume every time a
  same-sex interest was posted, attempting to drown it out

- Some people would attack our assertions that we derived some special
  sort of energy from same-sex interactions, saying things like
  "genitalia are just another sort of drag -- some day you'll mature
  to the point that you can get over silly hangups like the gender of
  your partner" and the like

- Even when neither of these were the case, some of us felt that the
  fair and typical distribution of volume among same-sex and different-sex
  interests resulted in our losing focus

Therefore, this list was set up to provide a forum in which people could
focus on specifically same-sex topics.

III.	Who is welcome to subscribe?  Who is welcome to post?

Despite the fact that the "gl" in the list name stands for "gay and
lesbian," subscription and posting provileges are not restricted to
people who identify as gay or lesbian.  People of all genders and 
orientations are welcome to subscribe.  The restriction on this list 
is one of subject matter, not membership.

People of all genders and orientations are welcome to post as well.
But remember that the topic of this list is *same-sex* interactions.
If you have a general point to make in a discussion of same-sex
topics, fine; but remember that there are many other spaces on the
Internet to discuss B&D/D&S/S&M in general, or interactions involving
different-sex participants.  Proclamations of your heterosexuality,
dropping your opposite-sex partners into discussion or examples, and
the like tend to cause the list to lose its focus.  If you're not
prepared to keep the discussion in a same-sex context, you might
consider whether other forums, like alt.sex.bondage or the THYST-L
mailing list (which has a more multi-orientational flavor, and is
especially suitable for people participating in actively bisexual
B&D/D&S/S&M arrangements), might not be more suitable to your tastes
and needs.

IV.	If people other than gay men and lesbians are welcome
	here, why the "gl" in the name?

It seemed like a good idea at the time, and once a list is set up
these days, information about it tends to be available in so many
slow-to-change media (like books and on-line indices) that changing
names is difficult.  Our list management software is expected to
be enhanced to allow lists to have aliases; when this is done, we will
probably change the name to something more appropriate to the charter.

V.	Why limit yourself?  What about the diversity of human
	experience?  Don't we all benefit from sharing in the broad
	range of human histories and influences?

Sure we do.  But not here.  As I said, we've experienced the down
side of being drowned out by a diverse environment.


Section 2:
How do I subscribe, unsubscribe, change formats, or retrieve
files and back issues?
------------------------------------------------------------

I.	What formats is the list available in?

gl-asb is available as a "reflector" list, where each message posted
to the list shows up as a separate message in your mailbox, or as a
"digest," where separate messages are batched up into one or two
mail bundles a day.

The Majordomo software we use to administer our lists actually
keeps track of these as two separate mailing lists, the former
called "gl-asb" and the latter "gl-asb-digest".

II.	How do I subscribe?

You subscribe by sending a mail message to

	majordomo@queernet.org

In the body of the message, you put a command, a line of specific
words in a specific format.  (Majordomo isn't a very bright software
package, but it makes our job a lot easier; you need to be very
careful about the format of the commands.)

If you wish to receive the reflector format, and have it delivered
to the address you sent the request from, put the line

	subscribe gl-asb

in the body of the message.  For the digest format, use the command

	subscribe gl-asb-digest

instead.

If you wish to specify an address other than the one that's automatically
taken from your mail's "From:" or "Reply-To:" headers (because the headers
are incorrect, or you're subscribing or unsubscribing an address on a
specific system), put the address at the end of the command line:

	subscribe gl-asb imkinky@bdsm.com

for example.

III.	How do I unsubscribe?

To unsubscribe, you also send a command to majordomo@queernet.org;
it would be

	unsubscribe gl-asb

or

	unsubscribe gl-asb-digest

depending on the list you're on.  Please note that sometimes your 
administrator changes your address, or the routing to it, without
your being aware of it, so you may need to specify the address in
the command like this:

	unsubscribe gl-asb imkinky@bdsm.com

The exact command you need is in your WELCOME message.

IV.	How do I switch from reflector to digest, or from digest
	to reflector?

Since Majordomo treats them as two separate lists, you need to
unsubscribe from the old format, and subscribe to the new format.
You can do this on multiple command lines in the same mail message:

	To: majordomo@queernet.org
	Subject: Doesn't matter

	unsubscribe gl-asb
	subscribe gl-asb-digest

V.	How much mail will I get?

On the average, gl-asb tends to have about five to 20 posts a day, in one
or two digests.

However, when you first subscribe, our mailer does you a "favor": it
sends you all queued mail, which is up to seven days' worth.  Don't
worry: after the initial burst, traffic stabilizes.

VI.	I just got mail telling me my request needs to be "approved".
	Why, and how long does this take?

Some of our lists have been subjected to harrassment by people who
send "die fags" mail to the lists.  (Thank you, Westboro Baptist
Church.)  In order to prevent this, we restrict permission so that
only subscribers can post.  We further have "closed" the subscription
process so we might screen out requests from known harrassers.  If
you've never harrassment-bombed us, your request will be approved --
there's no need to enclose your resume (although if the 8x10 glossies
are e-mailable, that might accelerate the process... only kidding,
but you can't blame a list administrator for trying).

While we normally approve requests on the same day, if the person who
needs to handle the request is traveling, you might face a several-day
delay.

VII.	How do I send mail to the list?

All mail to be distributed to all list members should go to 

     gl-asb@queernet.org

Be careful, in particular, when replying to mail received from the
list.  While most Macintosh, UNIX, and MS-DOS/Windows mail programs
handle the headers we supply correctly, and send mail back to the
entire list if you ask it to reply to all addressees (and allow you
to send a response to the original poster only, as well... more
on that later).  But some on-line services and BBS systems send
send replies to the incorrect address; you'll need to be sure it's
correct before you send it.  (This can be simplified by putting our
address in your alias list or address book or whatever your software
calls it.)

Note that your mail to addresses like "owner-gl-asb@queernet.org"
does NOT go to the list.  It only goes to me, and I may be able to
return it to you for correct addressing, but thar may be delayed 
as well.

VIII.	When should I send a reply to the list?  When should I send
	it to the original poster only?

Ask yourself if the other 500+ people on the list really want to
hear it.  (Then ask a second time.)  If you really just want to
send a personal note to the other party, please do so.

IX.	I sent mail to the list, a day or so has passed, and it
	hasn't appeared in my mailbox or in the digest.  Why?

One reason this can happen is that you may have posted from a
different system, or from a different AOL screen-name, or from a
system where the headers have changed since you subscribed, or from
a new host where your mail is forwarded to.  We try to find these
and tell you about them, but we can't always do so (or figure out
who you really are).

X.	Other than opposite-sex stuff, what shouldn't I post to
	the list?

For starters, anything that isn't about B&D/D&S/S&M, no matter how
tempting or important you think it is.  For example, many of our lists
recently received a lot of "Internet Virus" warnings.  Not only were
these not true and a big waste of bandwidth, but when one of these
situations really occurs, you'll probably be notified about it BY YOUR 
PROVIDER.

Announcements of publications or events that are B&D/D&S/S&M related
but may not have exclusively a same-sex nature, such as toy fairs, etc.
are welcome, but try to keep them short and devoid of opposite-sex-
specific content as well.  (This doesn't mean that you should lie
about or omit mention of celebs involved who are bi- or hetero-
identified.  But use a little common sense and sensitivity in 
applying this guideline.)

Next, anything that's an ad hominem attack raises the "temperature" of
any discussion without adding any content.  If you wish to insult
someone, please take it to private e-mail.

Finally, if someone is posting off-topic or otherwise inappropriately,
the temptation to respond on the list can be very strong, but it mainly
has the same effect as the original inappropriate posting.  Notify the
list management at "owner-gl-asb@queernet.org" about the issue instead.

XI.	How do I retrieve back issues of gl-asb from the archive?

You cannot retrieve individual posts at present, or search for messages
about specific subjects.  You can, however, retrieve specific issues
of the digest (whether you are a digest or reflector subscriber).

Each issue has a name of the format

	vXX.nYYY

where XX is replaced by the two-digit volume number (we are in volume
02 now), and YYY by the three-digit issue number.

For example, to retrieve Volume 1, Issue 12, subscribers to the
reflector format would put this line in the body of their mail to
majordomo@queernet.org:

	get gl-asb v01.n012

Digest subscribers would say

	get gl-asb-digest v01.n012

X.	How do I find out what's in the archive?

Send this command to majordomo@queernet.org:

	index gl-asb

or

	index gl-asb-digest

(Right now, we only have back issues.  But this could change.)

========================================================================

Enjoy your participation in the gl-asb list!

If you have any questions, drop a note to

STRICT SELF-BONDAGE
     
by David Stein
with Richard Sommers, M.D.


If nothing else, self-bondage has the advantage (as an anonymous wit once
said of masturbation) that you don't have to look your best. You needn't
impress or arouse anyone else. You can do it when you want, where you want
(up to a point!), whatever way you want, and for as long as you want. But the
one thing you must do to achieve safe and satisfying self-bondage is to keep
your head! Flying solo isn't better or worse than flying with a partner, but
solo bondage is a lot more demanding of the bottom (who's also, of course,
the top!) in terms of skill, discipline, and the ability to stay cool under
pressure.
     Last issue I distinguished two different kinds of self-bondage, the
"sensual" (where the sensations of immobility or constraint matter more than
the idea of inescapability) and the "strict" (where inescapability for a
preset time is the main turn-on). All the safety principles I discussed
earlier for sensual self-bondage apply just as much to strict self-bondage,
so let me repeat a few key points:
* Stay sober. Self-bondage can be fatal! Not often, but it does happen. You
need a clear mind and a steady hand to do it safely. 
* Never combine breath control with self-bondage, and be especially careful
with gags. Getting yourself out of self-imposed bondage will almost certainly
take longer than getting into it. Safe use of gags, however, requires that
someone--normally an unbound topman--be able to react instantly if the bottom
has a breathing problem. The same goes for a minimal-risk breath-control
scene (I don't think any breath-control scene can be risk-free). When you're
flying solo, it's important not to add any unnecessary risks to those already
inherent in the situation. If you use a gag, stick with a kind you can still
breathe around if your nose clogs up, such as a bit gag or a rope gag between
the teeth, and be sure you can remove it quickly and easily if necessary.
Gags that completely fill and seal the mouth, or lock on, or are applied
underneath other restraints (like a head harness or hood) are far too risky
for a solo bondage scene. 
* Don't tie yourself up with rope. I know, I know--rope is cheap, it's easy
to use, it feels good, it has all kinds of sexy associations. Unfortunately,
it's just not safe enough for self-bondage. Rope ties can be slippery and
unpredictable, and they make it much too easy to get yourself into a
situation you can't get out of. Locking steel cuffs, chains and padlocks, and
leather straps or cuffs secured by buckles or padlocks are all much easier to
control when you're doing it yourself. If you earned a merit badge in
knot-tying and feel you're an expert rope wrangler, fine, but make sure you
leave a good knife in reach!
* Cut yourself some slack. Despite the temptation to snug it all up just a
little more, leave enough slack to insure you can escape when you've had
enough. There won't be anyone else to release you if you can't (or at least
not without a long wait, horrible anxiety, and a great deal of embarrassment
at best). Self-bondage is risky enough without pushing your limits every
time.
* Handcuffs are much easier to put on than to take off even when you have the
key. Practice thoroughly with them alone before you combine handcuffs with
any other restraint that may escalate the difficulty. If possible, practice
getting into and out of handcuffs locked behind your back with a partner
present until you're sure you can do it easily on your own.

10,000 COMBINATIONS
     I don't believe there is any way to make what I've been calling "strict"
self-bondage--the kind where you cannot escape until some release mechanism
is triggered--absolutely safe. You can reduce the risks until you're
comfortable with them, but don't fool yourself that you've eliminated risk
entirely. As with solo mountain-climbing, skin-diving, or cave-crawling, even
when you take every reasonable precaution, accidents can still happen, and
you could die from one. On the other hand, you could be hit by a truck
crossing the street with the light. I'm not suggesting that we can or should
avoid all risks, only that we need to be realistic about them--and not let
our itchy pricks lead us to take greater risks than we'd otherwise be
comfortable with. 
     And there's no reason to be stupid about the risks we accept, either.
Peter Boots, who's been happily getting himself into and out of severe
bondage for more than two decades, advises that when it comes to release
mechanisms, it's best "to rely on very basic things: Ice melts, gravity makes
things drop, the sun rises in the morning. Some people use timers, motors,
electronics, but as soon as the power goes or something malfunctions they're
stuck. So far I have not come across a mechanical or electronic fail-safe
mechanism I would trust." (Issue #25 of Bound&Gagged includes a scary story
about just such a situation, "The Day the Fail-Safe Failed." Of course, the
writer of the story managed to get out anyway, but it was a very near escape,
and it cured him, at least, of reliance on such mechanisms.)
     For overnight scenes without a hood or blindfold, Peter uses a
four-digit combination lock to attach his cuffed hands and ankles to a chain
stretched across his bed (he likes to sleep in fetal position with his hands
and feet close together); you could use a similar setup to chain yourself to
the wall, the floor, or a post. "It's very tedious to try to get out while
it's dark," he notes, "as there are 10,000 different combinations to try, but
as soon as it gets light I can open the lock instantly." Peter strongly
advises against using a dial-type combination lock, as it's too easy to make
a mistake in the series of back-and-forth twists and turns needed to unlock
it even when you can see what you're doing. 

THE TWO-STRING THEORY
     A combination lock you know the code for is hardly inescapable during
the day, however, or if you're restrained loosely enough that you can move
around and turn on a light. For nonbedtime scenes, or shorter scenes, which
may involve a spreadeagle or other stretched-out position, Peter favors ice
and gravity for time release, and he uses a setup that involves two separate
strings or cords. At the end of one string is the critical key that will
enable him to free himself; the other end is attached to a hook on the wall
or ceiling in such a way that the key will hang straight down within easy
reach once he's in position on the bed. 
     Typically, the key unlocks either of the padlocks (they're keyed
identically) at the ends of a chain between one of his locking wrist cuffs
and one of the screw eyes at the corners of his bed. In a spreadeagle
position the key is handy to his right hand if he's on his back, to the left
hand if he's on his stomach. (Other arrangements are possible, such as
locking both wrist cuffs to the center of a chain stretched between the screw
eyes at the top corners of the bed, and similarly for the ankles, with the
cuffs attached to a chain at the foot of the bed.) If Peter weren't
interested in a delayed-release bondage scene, he could leave it at
that--when he was ready to release himself, he'd just grasp the dangling key
and use it. The trick of "strict" self-bondage, however, is to make the key
unavailable until after a certain amount of time has passed.
     Therefore, Peter prepares a second string whose sole function is to pull
the first string (the key string) out of reach. The second string has one end
frozen inside an ice cube (he always keeps several strings frozen into cubes
in his freezer!). He puts the ice cube under several other cubes in a coffee
mug, ties the free end of the frozen string to the first string somewhere
above the key, and places the mug far enough from the bed that the tension on
the frozen string pulls the key-holding string away from its previous
straight line down to his hand, thus holding the key out of reach. Until the
ice melts enough for the frozen string to pull free of the mug, the key to
his freedom might as well be in the next county, and Peter can enjoy the
feeling of being inescapably bound. How long that lasts is determined by the
temperature of the room and the size of the ice cubes. 
     Peter has experimented so that he knows just how long the key will stay
out of reach at his bedroom's normal room temperature. Of course, if it's
wintertime and the heat in the apartment goes off without warning, he may
have a longer wait, but with ordinary-size ice cubes it's unlikely to be an
intolerable one. Peter's experiments also covered some obvious variations,
such as freezing the second string in a whole cupful of water instead of in
one ice cube--the trouble is, the larger block of ice takes much longer to
melt, and the timing can vary over a much wider range, so he doesn't
recommend it. I also asked him about freezing the key itself in an ice cube
or cup of water and leaving that within reach, dispensing with the strings
entirely, but he pointed out that in that case there are a number of ways you
could accelerate the melting process (warming the ice with your hand or
another part of your body, blowing or pissing on it). Forcing the ice to melt
faster would get you out of bondage sooner, but that contradicts the whole
idea of a preset time during which you cannot escape.
     Peter's use of two strings is very important in making his arrangements
"fail-safe." I've read many single-string self-bondage scenarios in which a
key is suspended from a string frozen in ice so that it will drop into your
hand when the ice melts--but what if it misses your hand and falls to the
floor? Or bounces underneath the bed or behind a cabinet? It's far safer to
begin, as Peter does, with a tethered key hanging within reach, and then use
ice to keep it pulled out of the way for a preset time. Thus, instead of
depending on a time-release mechanism to reach the key, you're depending on
such a mechanism to withhold it from you; if the mechanism fails, you can
escape. 
     Peter stresses that in order to minimize the risks of delayed-release
self-bondage, good planning and lots of practice are essential--but practice
each step by itself, before you combine them into an arrangement that's
inescapable. "Test and check everything several times before you get going,"
he says. And if you possibly can, notify a friend before you embark on a solo
bondage scene, so that he can let you out if something goes wrong and you
don't call him back by an arranged time.
     Above all, if things go wrong, try not to panic. "Often there is an
alternative way out, however difficult," Peter notes. "But if the worst
should happen, you just have to make noise until the neighbors call the
police." That's another reason not to use a severe gag on yourself during any
strict self-bondage session, and it also suggests that it's safer not to
practice self-restraint in isolated locations far from any possible aid. If
that's where you happen to live, of course, you have to make the best of it,
but it's not a good idea to place yourself beyond all possible rescue if you
don't have to.

D.I.Y. OR DIE
     No one knows better than I do the frustration of really needing to be
tied up, but having no one willing, able, and trustworthy available to do the
honors. (For some reason, the supply of good tops is woefully short of the
demand--maybe because bottoms really do have more fun?) I've taken stupid
risks myself when need drove me, but as I've gotten older, wiser, and more
experienced, I find it easier to take a deep breath and think before snapping
the cuffs closed on my wrists or the padlock shut on the zipper of my hood. I
ask myself several questions, and unless I have a good answer to every one of
them, I either abort the session or go back to square one and plan it all
over again: Exactly how will I get out? Will I still be able to get out after
a few hours of lying, sitting, or standing in these restraints? What will I
do if my planned escape doesn't work? What is the worst that can happen if I
can't release myself?
     It's said that a hard cock has no conscience. It also doesn't have any
common sense, but no one is forcing us to reduce ourselves to our hard cocks.
If you want to enjoy self-bondage not only once but again and again, stay
sober and alert, plan carefully, don't push your limits too hard, and
practice, practice, practice! 

Special thanks to Peter Boots for his help with these columns on
self-bondage, and also to Bandana Boy and others on the Net whose posts I
learned from.

SM Gays is a social and educational group for gay men interested in 
consensual SM. It was founded nearly 15 years ago and meets monthly in 
Central London, England.

This month (January) SM Gays moved to a new home as its former venue 
closed down.

To counteract the somewhat cosy atmosphere of our new home at Club 180 
we commissioned a number of pieces of dungeon equipment including a 
double St Andrews Cross, a kee-klamp (scaffold) bondage cube and 
numerous bondage benches. Our dungeon space had suitable music from our 
DJ, Kavin, and planned and spontaneous demonstrations of rope bondage, 
mummification, hot wax scenes and some pretty heavy belting. 

Our inaugural event this last Wednesday was on the theme "Bondage for 
All" and attracted over 400 people. This must be an all-time record for 
attendance at a monthly SM club event.

So for those of you who think that post-Spanner Britain is an SM desert 
and we're all hiding in our closets, think again.

You can pay a lot at a tack shop, or you can order it cheapy and in
bulk from the Omaha Veterinary Supply Catalog (preferred by the kinky
everywhere!).  They have an 800 number.

Hello all!

I've been quiet for a while because I changed my email address (please note
the new one above if you write to me) and now have a proper provider.  I'm
just catching up on all the back issues I missed during the transfer.

It was particularly nice to read Bob Wingate's confession about his liking
for feet and socks and trainers which influences his choice of pictures in
Bound and Gagged.  It's a kink I've always had (long white tube socks!  and
grey ones!  and (British) football socks! - slurp) but it's one that I've
got into the habit of suppressing because The Scene demands Boots Boots and
More Boots and suitably Thick Macho Socks to go with them.  I love Docs, but
I used to like trainers too, and I've reluctantly but successfully weaned
myself off them.

NO TRAINERS
NO NAFF WHITE SOCKS
the dress code notice used to read at the Backstreeet (an old-established
leather bar in London's East End)

"I couldn't fuck you wearing those trainers," a well-known London top who
insists he is *not* a fetishist once told me.

...as if you can only be in the right state for inflicting horrendously
painful torments while dressed in the skin of six cows.  Oh well.

On another matter, I now have my own website (details below) which, like
most other web sites, is still under construction but worth having a peek
at.  If you want pervy stuff you'll have to find the playroom, which also
includes a long essay called BOUNDARIES that takes up some of the ideas
about the nature of sadomasochism I've previously aired in this forum.
Perhaps I should post it up here too...

Glad to see the list still remains healthily controversial!

Dunno why don (hi, don!) was reticent to give the address, but 
here it is for all and sundry (especially the latter <g>): 

  Collars, 1202 E. Pike St., #947, Seattle, WA 98122-3934. 

Subscriptions are US$15 a year in the U.S. US$20 in Canada, and 
US$25 for European addresses.  Dunno what it would be for the 
Far East.  I had a note about the cost of a sample copy but can't 
put my hands on it now.  Subscribers get to run a personal ad in 
each issue at no extra cost.

It's a modest but sincere publication that should be of great 
interest to anyone seriously into the Master/slave lifestyle.  
The emphasis is on real-life relationships, not fantasy.  There 
are no photos and no overt porn.  I've recommended it before and 
I'm happy to recommend it again.  

And for those cynical souls anxious to smell a rat, I don't 
write for "Collars" (not yet, anyway, though it did run a 
letter from me once) and have no financial interest in it.

In a recent post on "Forced Feeding," Des de Moor 
(dirkje@dircon.co.uk) asked about the technique of forced feeding
used on people involved in hunger strikes, etc.
 
Following is a description of a technique which can be used to
provide food and rehydration for people who may (for some unknown
reason) be restrained and involved in activities which render them
helpless to feed themselves---or helpless to reject food or liquid
provided by a generous and concerned top. (For example, if a
person were for some reason to be restrained, have a catheter
installed to prevent control of urinary functions, a Bardex enema
nozzle to flush his bowels periodically and without his consent or
control, periodic genital stimulation to prevent orgasm control,
periodic breathing restriction....well, you get the idea.)
 
If you get queasy, don't read the rest. The technique:
 
The required equipment is a long Levin tube or stomach tube, or
even a very long feeding catheter. The top should (not too subtly)
hold the tube up and use it to measure the approximate distance
from the bottom's nose to his stomach (use the navel as an approx-
imate guide); that's how much you'll insert. The bottom is invited
to recline, the catheter is *liberally* lubricated with plain KY
(not the type with Nonoxynol-9 added), and it is slowly inserted
up one nostril. It will go into the throat without difficulty.
(Some bottoms will at this point have a passing "gag" reflex. This
can be suppressed--and the entire procedure facilitated--by having
the bottom swallow repeatedly; remind him frequently.)
 
When the appropriate length of the tube has been inserted the
bottom will feel no particular pain, although there may be some
minor discomfort because some people just aren't used to having
something go into their nose and down the throat; that discomfort
will pass.
 
Be sure that the bottom's mouth is unobstructed during this
procedure; no gag or other restriction should be used. Besides,
you want the bottom to be able to tell you what he's feeling and
experiencing. Stroking the bottom's cock lightly while you insert
the tube will sometimes take the bottom's mind off any discomfort
and relieve any fear or anxiety.
 
THIS STEP IS IMPORTANT: Lightly clamp off the bottom's OTHER
nostril and make him shut his mouth and EXHALE. Place your ear
immediately next to the distal end of the tube; you should hear or
feel NO air coming from the tube. There may be some leakage of air
around the tube, but it will come from the nostril in which the
tube is inserted, not from the tube itself. If you hear a flow of
air from the tube, you have inadvertently inserted the tube into
his lung rather than his stomach; the tube must be removed and re-
inserted. You don't want to fill up his lung with fluid.
 
To provide food or rehydration via this tube, a large catheter-tip
syringe is helpful; the 60cc type used to withdraw urine from a
urethral catheter is ideal. Simply fill the syringe with liquid
food such as "Ensure" or with water, and send it down the tube to
the bottom's stomach.  
 
Monitor the bottom's urine output if the scene is a long one; be
sure he gets enough fluid  to make up for fluid lost through the
bladder. When removing the tube, simply pull it out slowly and
gently, and immediately allow the bottom to blow his nose to
remove any residual lubricant so it doesn't drip back down his
throat.
 
CAUTIONS: This is a fairly sophisticated type of control scene.
Monitor the bottom's ability to breathe constantly; do not attempt
this kind of scene if the bottom is suffering from a cold or from
any illness which restricts normal breathing through the nostril
you're not using. If the bottom should get into a coughing fit,
it's best to remove the tube. Be sure the tube used is suited to
this purpose; it should have a smooth tip so as not to irritate
the nasal and esophageal passages and ideally a side "eye" to
avoid problems of clogging from mucous. Needless to say, it is
possible there could be transfer of germs from the tube to the
bottom, so it should be sterilized before use; ordinary bacteria
in the air are not so much of a concern as those special pathogens
which are transmitted from person to person directly or via
contaminated equipment.
 
I hope the women reading this posting will not be offended by the
use of the words him/his above. I don't mean to be "un-inclusive;"
I am writing from my own experience. I'm sure our female readers
can adapt both the technique and the language to their own needs.

The GL-ASB and GL-ASB-DIGEST mailing lists
==========================================
This fairly long message outlines the policies and procedures for these
mailing lists.  Please read it thoroughly, and save it for future 
reference.


Section 1:
What is it?  Who can subscribe?  What may be posted?
----------------------------------------------------

I.	What is "gl-asb"?

"gl-asb" is a mailing list for discussion of B&D/D&S/S&M interests and
practices involving same-sex partners.

II.	Why does this require separate space?

Many of the folks involved in the establishment of this list were
subscribers to the Usenet newsgroup "alt.sex.bondage"; hence the
historical "asb" in its name.  

Some of us at the time felt that our presence on alt.sex.bondage was
limited by some or all of the following factors:

- Some other people were uncomfortable with same-sex postings, and
  seemed to post back with extra ferocity and volume every time a
  same-sex interest was posted, attempting to drown it out

- Some people would attack our assertions that we derived some special
  sort of energy from same-sex interactions, saying things like
  "genitalia are just another sort of drag -- some day you'll mature
  to the point that you can get over silly hangups like the gender of
  your partner" and the like

- Even when neither of these were the case, some of us felt that the
  fair and typical distribution of volume among same-sex and different-sex
  interests resulted in our losing focus

Therefore, this list was set up to provide a forum in which people could
focus on specifically same-sex topics.

III.	Who is welcome to subscribe?  Who is welcome to post?

Despite the fact that the "gl" in the list name stands for "gay and
lesbian," subscription and posting provileges are not restricted to
people who identify as gay or lesbian.  People of all genders and 
orientations are welcome to subscribe.  The restriction on this list 
is one of subject matter, not membership.

People of all genders and orientations are welcome to post as well.
But remember that the topic of this list is *same-sex* interactions.
If you have a general point to make in a discussion of same-sex
topics, fine; but remember that there are many other spaces on the
Internet to discuss B&D/D&S/S&M in general, or interactions involving
different-sex participants.  Proclamations of your heterosexuality,
dropping your opposite-sex partners into discussion or examples, and
the like tend to cause the list to lose its focus.  If you're not
prepared to keep the discussion in a same-sex context, you might
consider whether other forums, like alt.sex.bondage or the THYST-L
mailing list (which has a more multi-orientational flavor, and is
especially suitable for people participating in actively bisexual
B&D/D&S/S&M arrangements), might not be more suitable to your tastes
and needs.

IV.	If people other than gay men and lesbians are welcome
	here, why the "gl" in the name?

It seemed like a good idea at the time, and once a list is set up
these days, information about it tends to be available in so many
slow-to-change media (like books and on-line indices) that changing
names is difficult.  Our list management software is expected to
be enhanced to allow lists to have aliases; when this is done, we will
probably change the name to something more appropriate to the charter.

V.	Why limit yourself?  What about the diversity of human
	experience?  Don't we all benefit from sharing in the broad
	range of human histories and influences?

Sure we do.  But not here.  As I said, we've experienced the down
side of being drowned out by a diverse environment.


Section 2:
How do I subscribe, unsubscribe, change formats, or retrieve
files and back issues?
------------------------------------------------------------

I.	What formats is the list available in?

gl-asb is available as a "reflector" list, where each message posted
to the list shows up as a separate message in your mailbox, or as a
"digest," where separate messages are batched up into one or two
mail bundles a day.

The Majordomo software we use to administer our lists actually
keeps track of these as two separate mailing lists, the former
called "gl-asb" and the latter "gl-asb-digest".

II.	How do I subscribe?

You subscribe by sending a mail message to

	majordomo@queernet.org

In the body of the message, you put a command, a line of specific
words in a specific format.  (Majordomo isn't a very bright software
package, but it makes our job a lot easier; you need to be very
careful about the format of the commands.)

If you wish to receive the reflector format, and have it delivered
to the address you sent the request from, put the line

	subscribe gl-asb

in the body of the message.  For the digest format, use the command

	subscribe gl-asb-digest

instead.

If you wish to specify an address other than the one that's automatically
taken from your mail's "From:" or "Reply-To:" headers (because the headers
are incorrect, or you're subscribing or unsubscribing an address on a
specific system), put the address at the end of the command line:

	subscribe gl-asb imkinky@bdsm.com

for example.

III.	How do I unsubscribe?

To unsubscribe, you also send a command to majordomo@queernet.org;
it would be

	unsubscribe gl-asb

or

	unsubscribe gl-asb-digest

depending on the list you're on.  Please note that sometimes your 
administrator changes your address, or the routing to it, without
your being aware of it, so you may need to specify the address in
the command like this:

	unsubscribe gl-asb imkinky@bdsm.com

The exact command you need is in your WELCOME message.

IV.	How do I switch from reflector to digest, or from digest
	to reflector?

Since Majordomo treats them as two separate lists, you need to
unsubscribe from the old format, and subscribe to the new format.
You can do this on multiple command lines in the same mail message:

	To: majordomo@queernet.org
	Subject: Doesn't matter

	unsubscribe gl-asb
	subscribe gl-asb-digest

V.	How much mail will I get?

On the average, gl-asb tends to have about five to 20 posts a day, in one
or two digests.

However, when you first subscribe, our mailer does you a "favor": it
sends you all queued mail, which is up to seven days' worth.  Don't
worry: after the initial burst, traffic stabilizes.

VI.	I just got mail telling me my request needs to be "approved".
	Why, and how long does this take?

Some of our lists have been subjected to harrassment by people who
send "die fags" mail to the lists.  (Thank you, Westboro Baptist
Church.)  In order to prevent this, we restrict permission so that
only subscribers can post.  We further have "closed" the subscription
process so we might screen out requests from known harrassers.  If
you've never harrassment-bombed us, your request will be approved --
there's no need to enclose your resume (although if the 8x10 glossies
are e-mailable, that might accelerate the process... only kidding,
but you can't blame a list administrator for trying).

While we normally approve requests on the same day, if the person who
needs to handle the request is traveling, you might face a several-day
delay.

VII.	How do I send mail to the list?

All mail to be distributed to all list members should go to 

     gl-asb@queernet.org

Be careful, in particular, when replying to mail received from the
list.  While most Macintosh, UNIX, and MS-DOS/Windows mail programs
handle the headers we supply correctly, and send mail back to the
entire list if you ask it to reply to all addressees (and allow you
to send a response to the original poster only, as well... more
on that later).  But some on-line services and BBS systems send
send replies to the incorrect address; you'll need to be sure it's
correct before you send it.  (This can be simplified by putting our
address in your alias list or address book or whatever your software
calls it.)

Note that your mail to addresses like "owner-gl-asb@queernet.org"
does NOT go to the list.  It only goes to me, and I may be able to
return it to you for correct addressing, but thar may be delayed 
as well.

VIII.	When should I send a reply to the list?  When should I send
	it to the original poster only?

Ask yourself if the other 500+ people on the list really want to
hear it.  (Then ask a second time.)  If you really just want to
send a personal note to the other party, please do so.

IX.	I sent mail to the list, a day or so has passed, and it
	hasn't appeared in my mailbox or in the digest.  Why?

One reason this can happen is that you may have posted from a
different system, or from a different AOL screen-name, or from a
system where the headers have changed since you subscribed, or from
a new host where your mail is forwarded to.  We try to find these
and tell you about them, but we can't always do so (or figure out
who you really are).

X.	Other than opposite-sex stuff, what shouldn't I post to
	the list?

For starters, anything that isn't about B&D/D&S/S&M, no matter how
tempting or important you think it is.  For example, many of our lists
recently received a lot of "Internet Virus" warnings.  Not only were
these not true and a big waste of bandwidth, but when one of these
situations really occurs, you'll probably be notified about it BY YOUR 
PROVIDER.

Announcements of publications or events that are B&D/D&S/S&M related
but may not have exclusively a same-sex nature, such as toy fairs, etc.
are welcome, but try to keep them short and devoid of opposite-sex-
specific content as well.  (This doesn't mean that you should lie
about or omit mention of celebs involved who are bi- or hetero-
identified.  But use a little common sense and sensitivity in 
applying this guideline.)

Personal ads are inappropriate for the list; they change the tone of
the list so that, over time, it becomes a pickup space and not much
more.  We have a weekly distribution of ads to the list, however, in
order to allow people to get in contact without changing the tone of
the discussion list.  Send personal ads to "gl-asb-personals@queernet.org".

Next, anything that's an ad hominem attack raises the "temperature" of
any discussion without adding any content.  If you wish to insult
someone, please take it to private e-mail.

Finally, if someone is posting off-topic or otherwise inappropriately,
the temptation to respond on the list can be very strong, but it mainly
has the same effect as the original inappropriate posting.  Notify the
list management at "owner-gl-asb@queernet.org" about the issue instead.

XI.	How do I retrieve back issues of gl-asb from the archive?

You cannot retrieve individual posts at present, or search for messages
about specific subjects.  You can, however, retrieve specific issues
of the digest (whether you are a digest or reflector subscriber).

Each issue has a name of the format

	vXX.nYYY

where XX is replaced by the two-digit volume number (we are in volume
02 now), and YYY by the three-digit issue number.

For example, to retrieve Volume 1, Issue 12, subscribers to the
reflector format would put this line in the body of their mail to
majordomo@queernet.org:

	get gl-asb v01.n012

Digest subscribers would say

	get gl-asb-digest v01.n012

X.	How do I find out what's in the archive?

Send this command to majordomo@queernet.org:

	index gl-asb

or

	index gl-asb-digest

(Right now, we only have back issues.  But this could change.)
