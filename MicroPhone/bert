Everyone/Anyone,

This is a very long and in some areas detailed letter.  I suggest you
schedule/reserve some time to read it, not skim it.  You will find it of
interest.  I write it from the heart.

Bert AKA PrisonGuy - Head Trustee Eagle Correctional Facilities.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I just got back from a S&M run called Delta '97 and had a time that will
interest most, if not all of you.  I participated in a prison cabin,
actually I (with LOTS of help) ran it.  Before the trip report, I need to
cover another subject.

Why?  Because to understand the cabin properly, you need to understand
the overall setting.  I discussed with a my sensi (sic?), my advisor, and
an important cog in Delta this trip report.  He feels while it is
important, understanding DI (not Drill Instructor <G>) is important.

He is willing to talk one on one (E-mail or phone) with those interested
in DI or Delta '98.  His name is Harold Cox (Editor of Checkmate
Magazine) and his E-mail address is hcox@microserve.net.  He is getting a
copy of this note and my trip report.



What is Delta International?

Delta International is a brotherhood of men who join together to put on
an annual S&M run.  IMHO, it goes beyond the annual S&M run and into
promoting S&M as a safe, sane, consensual, and accepted activity.

The run is by invitation only from members who agree to be responsible
for those they invite.



What is my (Bert Moshier) experience?

This is as broad of question, as I meant it.  I will break the answer
into three sections, Prior to Delta '95, at Delta '95, and after Delta
'95.

     Prior to Delta '95:

Prior to June 1995, I didn't even know what S&M meant, let alone the
details.  My entire interest was prison and specifically the:

     light steel bondage
     humilation (verbal, clothing, and psychological)

scene.  I was no light player spending entire weekends in a self defined
prison scene.  Allowing it to end only upon release or special
circumstance.  I created this prison list to find others, to learn, to
share, to grow.  I thank Yossie Silverman in getting me see beyond my own
cellblock and into the larger prison.  His information helped me
recognize Harold during our first meeting.

I visited The Academy June of 1995 in hopes of seeing how fair my limits
in light steel bondage and humilation could go.  I knew from solo
experiences, but not when someone else was in complete control.  I
expressed these needs in conversation and a letter to Chip.  While I
still don't know, I did meet Bob Riete and Harold Cox.

Even in my little world I could put one and one together and realize in
front of me was Mr. Prison Scene.  People would talk to me of him not by
name but by reputation.  "These guys run their own prison.  The man who
defines prison power."  Today, I add to this list, Mr. SSC (Safe, Sane,
and Consensual).

About a month later Harold called me on the phone wondering about where
I'd like to go with my interest.  We discussed prison and he led me into
a S&M discussion.  To be completely honestly, I didn't even know for what
the initials stood, let alone the meaning!!!

Harold took his time, explaining he was into general S&M.  One could
specialize but his interest was prison and general S&M.  He covered
several of S&M areas.  I tried unsuccessfully relating in my mind these
to the prison scene.

He told me about his first "power/sexual" prison experience.  I won't
relate it now or in the future.  It is his and not mine.  He invited me
to Delta '95, a S&M run.

I will say two items helped me decide to attend Delta '95:

     - I have an open mind willing to learn, try, and consider
       new things.  I know my limits are great but working in
       a team allows us to exceed our individual possibilities.

     - Harold's prison interest.  I could tell I was in touch
       with a man with a great prison interest.  If he saw
       value in S&M and thought it helped his prison fantasies,
       then I must also try to learn, develop, and expand.

While accepting, I told him I didn't see how S&M related to prison.

     At Delta '95:

For the first two days of Delta '95, I just walked around watching.  I
found it:

     - Interesting from a mental perspective.  Specifically, in
       how I could use it on prison boys or a prison could use
       it on me.

     - Concerning from a personal perspective

My concern was in trying the stuff with someone with whom I was
comfortable.  I was looking to join, in but with someone with whom I
could relate to in a non-S&M manner first.  Why?  I don't know nor even
worry about it.

Five events at Delta changed my life forever!

     Event One:

All the different activities.  I saw for the FIRST time - Handballing
(fisting), tit torture, Cock and Ball torture, electric play, flogging,
whipping, spanking, suspension, etc.  I would spend hours just watching
the reaction of tops and bottoms.

I saw the most beautiful love between two Men ever in a handballing
scene.  I won't call it Fisting, it was love making.  Don't forget I
never saw Handballing/Fisting before.  And it had been over 15 years
since I had made love with another man.

     Event Two:

Ivan!  I was in lust, 6'6", hair to his waist.  I broke the ice on the
basis of his hair.  We talked about growing, maintaining it, and
advantages/disadvantages.

He asked me about my S&M interests, as he observed I had been just
watching for two days.  I never realized people watched me.  I thought I
was just a fly on the wall, another face in the crowd, SINCE no one
really knew me.  I still have a hard time getting over this when I don't
think people know me ... any help from someone?

I told him what you just read.  All of it.  He offerred to let me
experience an around the world.  This is where would start with a feather
and work his way up.  I explained how Harold saw me being a top.  Hence,
I wanted to learn not just have stuff done to me.  He agreed to show and
explain to me before doing it.

     NOTE:  Ivan is straight.  He and his wife were the 1995 New England
     Flogging Champions.  Of course, she was not there as Delta is men
     only - gay, bi, and straight but not narrow.

I started with the feather and ended up over an hour later with a
cat-of-nine tails at medium strength.  He then asked me what I'd like to
try over again.  It was the cat-of-nine tails and harder.  One strong hit
and I had him back down to medium but continue.  I don't remember the
total number but it would not surprise me if it wasn't fifteen plus.

Ivan then asked if I'd like to try something else - a PVC tube which
would act as a cane.  I agreed.  It was pure sting on my back.  Cool, but
I'm not a sting guy.  Yet, we continued.  The second hit broke the skin
across the back, I started to bleed, and the scene ended.

I went back to my cabin (also Harold's cabin) a new man.  I can't explain
it other than I was in a greater world.  I learned about myself and grew.
My pride on the marks was great and so was some inner strength/knowledge.

HONESTLY, I would love to experience it again.  YET, I have yet to find a
top who takes the time to warm me up as Ivan.  Except for the bleeding
and coldness (after midnight in PA), I was no where at an end.  What
would be beyond the cat-of-nine tails, I don't know.

*****  Any SSC tops out there who would like to find out, PLEASE let me know! *****

     Event Three:

I went to an electric demo given by Harold Cox.  He used prison scenes as
examples of electric play.  One was how the OK State Prison would use old
telephones during the 1930 and 40s (maybe even 50s and 60s).  Stun guns,
etc.  I started seeing where guys would like mixing S&M with prison.

     Event Four:

I met a member of this list at Delta '95.  People were sharing their
interests and I was discussing prison.  The guy asked me if I was
PrisonGuy, to which I answered yes.  He told me who he was and off to the
race we went (discussions nothing more).

He asked me to give him a prison scene!  We went back to my cabin and we
did a prison induction, followed by some close order movement.  He
escaped me and in recapturing my convict boy, he fell down.  After having
the nurse on duty check him out, he wanted to continue.  I'm grateful to
him!  I don't know how things today would be otherwise.  FOR ....

We got to the main dungeon, he had a flogging scene arranged with another
top.  Hence, I was his prison escort to his flogging.  Looking back on
it, I can see how he could use it as a way to create a mind set for the
flogging.  I don't know if he did but it turns out guys do use it this
way.

He asked if I'd like to be his flogging top under the other top's
direction.  YES!  So on the last night of Delta, I did my first flogging
as a top.  It lasted quiet awhile, maybe two hours.  I would go alone, we
would double team him, and the other top would go alone.

     Event Five:

The next morning Harold wanted to talk to me.  He said I exceeded his
expectations.  He expected one of two things:

     - I'd look at the stuff.  Go away and call him back in a couple
       of months either interested in more or wanting just prison
       stuff.

     - I'd leave early saying, "Thanks but no thanks.  Let us just
       discuss prison."

Instead he says, I bottomed and not lightly and then topped in two
different scenes.  It was time for me to "start my own cabin."  He didn't
say it was time for me to move to another cabin.  He said "start my own
cabin."

     Was I shocked!  Remember two months earlier I didn't even know
     what S&M was...  OK, I had decades of self prison experiences
     and Internet work, but ...

I suggested a prison cabin.  His very immediate reply was others had been
asking since the concept of Delta.  He refused them because he didn't
want to detract from Delta itself, from the impromptu scenes, by creating
a controlled environment.

I suggested a work release program.  NOTE:  Harold is military; I'm
civilian when it comes to prison.  He translated this to a CCP (Custodial
Correction Program) and thought about it.  He liked the idea and asked me
to prepare a plan.

Finally, he got me a contact of another Delta attendee in FL to look up.
As I told him, I didn't want to just not do any S&M until next Delta!

     After Delta '95:

I met up with the other Delta attendee and we hit it off.  Not quickly
but just like Ivan slow at the start and now very strong.  He is a bottom
and we do play but not much.  Why?

He introduced me to my Dad, who I love greatly!  Why would this inhibit
our play?  At first because we didn't want to affect my relationship with
Dad.  After talking with Dad over the last year, today we play.  (Though
at Delta '97 we never found the time :-((((, I was busy with the cabin,
which is another note.)

The next year saw me move from Boca to Austin and gain a daughter.
Arranging a prison cabin just didn't come off for Delta '96.  Harold
offerred a bunk in his cabin.  I immediately agreed and again tried new
stuff and re-enforced old.

I did electric, spanking, more flogging, more prison scenes and for more
guys!  I topped (humilation, spanking, flogging, and prison) and bottomed
(electric, flogging, and spanking).

I came home with prison cabin ideas.  They included which cabins to use,
activities, etc.  I wrote up the plan and the rest is history and for
another note.  Somethings went well and others didn't.  Bottom line,
though, is everyone had a good to outstanding time.  Harold wants to do
Prison Cabin '98 with ...

I'm getting well ahead of myself.  This is a background note on Delta and
how I went from 100% prison to including and loving S&M.


Where is my S&M interest today?  Am I like Harold with a general S&M interest?

My S&M interest is combining the many different S&M aspects/areas in
short and long term roleplaying, especially prison roleplaying.  While I
enjoy the "short" one area scene and need to do them (e.g. relax through
a good flogging), my real interest is roleplaying.

Is this like Harold's S&M interest?  Only Harold can say.  Harold?  <G>

Hi,

I will be staying with a relative, an Aunt by marriage once removed (I think).  My
Aunt (blood relative) marries guy A, they break up, and he marries woman B.  She
becomes the step-mother of my cousins and continues to be active in their lives
today.  I'm staying with "woman B."  Is this what they mean by once removed?

In any case, I wanted to give this very short list of people my phone number in
Colorado Springs.  I'll be there until I find a new place.  Please be careful
when calling!

	719/596-7211 ... Her name is Dee

Also you can contact me through Oracle in Colorado Springs.  The operator will
direct your phone call.

Obviously, I will keep this list of people up to date as things occurs (e.g. my
own place, phone, etc.)  If possible, say hi to me from time to time.  Lots of
changes are going on and ... the stress is high.  I bit a guy's - who I didn't
know - head off for a minor reason the other day (and at the same time hurt
the friendship of a guy who watched).

Bert.
