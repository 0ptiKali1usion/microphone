This is a very interesting straitjacket.  The only time I've ever seen 
anything similar was a movie still I came across years ago in a book 
concerning sex and violence in movies.  Unfortunately, the still was 
uncredited, but the intimation was that it was from a French film.  Where did 
you get these stills?

Subject: Common Interest in straight jackets
Status: RO
X-Status: 

Hi there,
    I saw the post on the internet...trying to identify the straight 
jacket.  Unfortunately, I can't help identify it...  It doesn't look 
like the Posey or Humane straight jackets that I own...nor does it look 
like any of the "custom" jackets in my small collection (leather, 
rubber, and canvas).
    I'm always looking for new sources of straight jackets, though.  
I'm currently looking for used or surplus straight jackets....that are 
in good condition, but may be unique or have an interesting history.  
I'm sure that there must be a abundent supply...somewhere...now that 
the medical establishment no longer looks with favor on the use of 
heavy duty physical restraint...when it is so easy to prescribe a few 
extra pills to an individual.
    I would be very grateful if would share with me any information 
that you obtain regarding the straight jacket in your posting...or in 
relation to other new/used/surplus institutional restraint items.... 
especially straight jackets.
    I hope to hear from you in the near future.
                Sincerely, 
                        cthomas6@ix.netcom.com
