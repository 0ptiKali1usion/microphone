PHOTOWORKS DARKROOM FOR WINDOWS!

PHOTOWORKS DARKROOM is the professional graphics package with a full 
complement of functions and beautifully designed for quick mastery.  
Now you can erase the unwanted people and objects (like telephone 
poles) that detract from an otherwise great photograph.  This includes 
removing scratches or unflattering backgrounds.  Paint, edit and enhance 
your photos the way an expensive professional would do it ...all with the 
touch of a button. And you can draw from your PhotoWorks Plus albums 
to enhance those photos needing a touch-up.  Imagine being able to go 
back to those once-of-a-lifetime photos that were less than perfect 
because of "red eye" in one of the subjects or some stranger walking 
through the background.  Now you can restage the picture the way it 
should have been.

PhotoWorks DarkRoom takes the mystery and lengthy learning curve out of 
high-level image enhancement. But the fun and creativity is fully intact.

Developing your own designs has never been easier.  Special effects, 
unusual filters and a well equipped library of free photos, sound 
effects and video clips augment your creative ability.  All royalty 
and license free. In no time, you'll be able to edit, cut, copy and 
paste images, as well as charts, graphics, and text, from one Windows 
application to another. 

Price:  $39.95 -- CD version only.

To Order:  Call 1-800 FILMWORKS and ask for PhotoWorks 
DarkRoom for Windows, and use order code number M665.
