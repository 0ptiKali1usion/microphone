Al,  When do you want to head out to the thrift stores,
     surplus places, and swap meets again.  I have been missing you.

My ``last'' long time in a SJ was 36 hours.  You can borrow my Possy.
Possy and Humane Restraint both make "Standard" SJs.  I like the Possy
better.  I also have a chain-mail one and one that I made out of heavy
nylon.  What time Saturday?  The SW Liquidators close at noon.  - Louis
