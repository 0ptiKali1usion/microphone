<an444075@anon.penet.fi> asks:

"AI (Amnesty International)  sent me a plea for 
funds that had three rough sketches of a Japanese
HOGOBO restraint.  It had a strap around the waist with 2
wrist restraints, one in the front and one in the back.

Has anyone played with a HOGOBO?  
How is the strap secured around waist?  
Do the wrist restraints lock?  
Does anyone know of a US source if this style of restraint?  
Any ideas on how to get one out of Japan?"


To which I reply:

     Get me a copy of these pictures and I'll see if I can't work one up
for you.
