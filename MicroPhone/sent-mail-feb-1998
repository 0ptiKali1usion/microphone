I don't know your plans for Saturday.  Southwest Liquidators is only

It was fun.  I expect to be quite busy the next 2 weeks.
A relative -- kid (14y) is comming
to stay with us.  We will be going to Mexico
Douglas, Bisbee, San Diego and other places.

So Deb & I will need to shuffel our work schedules so that
he is not alone for the time he is here in Tucson.

Lets plan on a tour of my play space some time.  I think you will like it.

It should keep for 20 or so years without any problems.

We have had 2 inches in Feb.  No rain worth talking about in Jan.
It should  (has) helped the wild flowers ( I was out today.)
I went walking in the Catalina mountains.  Hope all is well.  - Louis

Stephen,

There will be many problems.  All computers will not stop working.
In fact, very few will actually stop.  Some will produce some VERY dumb
"answers" though.  A lot of programs have arleady been fixed.  They needed
to be.  Mortgage programs, leasing programs, and driver's licence programs
(and the like) all deal with dates past the year 2000.  I have heard of
people over 100 getting cards to come in with their parents
for free ice-cream.  I am sure that the advertiser was not targeting 
106 year olds!  Bills may get sent out for 100 years of service and such.
(They won't get paid)  Social Security is expected to have problems.
The FAA is expected to have some problems.  I will not fly Dec31 or Jan1
that "year".

There is a LOT of stuff on the web about it.  You may want to search for
"Year 2000" and Y2000.  (One address [about sun's products] is
http://www.sun.com/y2000) 

Some PC hardware internal clocks will not handle it correctly.  But
a small patch in the software will fix it.  Some people are estimating
the total cost (including the lawyers) at $600 billon.  I think I
might just place a long distance call at midnight (GMT) just to check out
the phone company.  It might be fun to get a bill for a 100 year phone
call!  They could never collect!
