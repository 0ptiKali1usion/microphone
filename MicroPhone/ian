        Hi Lewis,  Thanks for calling last night.  Sorry that I was less
than my usual enthusiastic self.  I was asleep and as mentioned get up
rather early.  I'm not very alert when awakened.  Also my daughter was
"interested" in my phone call that late at night.  But I really would be
interested in keeping in touch.  Your stuff sounds pretty neat.  I actually
really get off on being inescapably tied up and when I am tied up I really
don't want to escape.  Probably because I don't get tied up often enough and
haven't been tied up past what I like.  Thanks again.  Ian

Hi Louis.  Let me know if you get this.  I'm still uncertain if this is
correct.   Thanks for the stuff.  What on earth I'm going to do with it is
beyond me but I'll figure something out.  The pressure pants have a brokeen
valve and more strings and stuff than imaginable.
Hope you are well.  I went to the last NW Bondage Club event with the
understanding that I was going to play with TK but he was late, made himself
busy and later played with another guy,  so I must be old meat for him.
Lesson learned.
I'm off to Nashville in the AM.  I really need a nap.  Take care,  Ian
